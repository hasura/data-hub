## Copy your API endpoint

1. Get the Content API endpoint from your project API access settings.

   !["Hygraph get endpoint"](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/data-hub/graphcms/gcms-endpoint.png)
2. Add your endpoint to Hasura's remote API config.  
   !["Hasura add remote endpoint"](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/data-hub/graphcms/hasura-add-endpoint.png)

If your API is open, your work is done. If your API is not open, continue below.

## Set your content access controls (optional)

If your project is not open to all (Public API Permissions), then you will want to create a Permanent Auth Token.

1. Inside your API access settings, click "Create token". Give it a name, and set the stage which content should be delivered from - typically "Published".

   !["Name Token"](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/data-hub/graphcms/name-token.png)
   !["Create Permissions"](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/data-hub/graphcms/create-permissions.png)
2. Set your Content API Permissions. You can initialize the defaults (read all published models with all locales), or configure specific models in which Hasura can access.  
   !["API Permisions"](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/data-hub/graphcms/api-permissions.png)
3. Then add the following Authorization header to the remote schema config:
   `Authorization: Bearer GRAPHCMS_TOKEN_HERE`
